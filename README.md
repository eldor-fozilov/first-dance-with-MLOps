# first-dance-with-MLOps

I am pretty well aware of the mathematics & intuition behind many machine learning algorithms and I also became quite good at building / implementing them to solve real world problems. However, I always knew that building ML models is only a small part of the whole ML system (as you can see in the image below).

This is why I decided, as an initial dive to the field of MLOPs, to take the [**"Machine Learning Engineering for Production"**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) specialization offered by [**DeepLearning.AI**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera. Generally, the specialization covered how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production. It offered the following 4 courses:

* [**Introduction to Machine Learning in Production**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-production?specialization=machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)
* [**Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-lifecycle-in-production?specialization=machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)
* [**Machine Learning Modeling Pipelines in Production**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-modeling-pipelines-in-production?specialization=machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)
* [**Deplyoing Machine Learning Models in Production**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deploying-machine-learning-models-in-production?specialization=machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)

By completing all of those 4 courses, I was able to learned and acquire some practice in the following things:
* Design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modeling strategies, and deployment requirements
* Establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype how to develop, deploy, and continuously improve a productionized ML application
* Build data pipelines by gathering, cleaning, and validating datasets
* Implement feature engineering, transformation, and selection with TensorFlow Extended
* Establish data lifecycle by leveraging data lineage and provenance metadata tools and follow data evolution with enterprise data schemas
* Apply techniques to manage modeling resources and best serve offline/online inference requests
* Use analytics to address model fairness, explainability issues, and mitigate bottlenecks
* Deliver deployment pipelines for model serving that require different infrastructures
* Apply best practices and progressive delivery techniques to maintain a continuously operating production system

Most importanly, I got a very good general understanding of the field and what I should learn in detail to excel at it.

**Definitely recommend taking this specialization if you want to build a career in ML Engineering and Data Science!**
